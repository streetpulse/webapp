webapp
======

Emberjs based webapp for streetpulse. Note that this app is supposed to use our api available at:

`app.street-pulse.org/api/`
For More info on the api, check out the documentation at `www.street-pulse.org/api/`

all libs are included in staging (uncompressed) and production mode (minified). To switch between the two just change the symbolic link 'libs' so that it points to the right directory.


Enjoy!
